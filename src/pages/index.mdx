The Hoosier Community Coalition stands at the forefront of Indiana's fight for social justice, civil rights, and democratic values. We believe that when communities organize together, we can create lasting change that benefits everyone.

  No Kings: A Call to Action
</CoalitionTitle>

The No Kings movement represented our fundamental belief that democracy requires active participation from every citizen. We reject the notion that any individual, regardless of wealth or political position, should wield unchecked power over our communities.
The Hoosier Community Coalition intends to continue supporting that. 

**Our Demands:**
- Transparent and accountable governance
- Protection of voting rights for all citizens
- Economic justice and fair taxation
- Civil rights protections for marginalized communities
- Environmental justice and sustainable policies

**How You Can Get Involved:**
- Attend our monthly organizing meetings
- Join peaceful demonstrations and rallies
- Contact your representatives about key legislation
- Volunteer for voter registration drives
- Support community education initiatives

Together, we can build a democracy that truly serves the people.
